I believe that at most of the time, it will be Milk! Milk is very important in our daily life. We can directly drink it, and we can also drink it with coffee, or with cereal. Many food are made with milk, such as cheese, ice-cream, and etc. Milk is everywhere in our life! According to Statista, the U.S per capita consumption of dairy products is around 655 pounds in 2020. With the large consumption of milk in the U.S, it stimulates our interests that how much milk is produced every year in the United States and how much profits can farmers make by selling milk and milk products? With the curiosity about the milk production in the United States, we went to the U.s. Department of Agriculture and the Economic Research Service website, and found an interesting data set called Milk Cost of Production Estimates, which includes the average pounds of milk produced each year among the States in the U.S.The data set also includes the income, expenditure, and opportunity cost of milk production from year 2016 to year 2020. The income category includes the money gained from selling milk, milk products, and etc. The cost categories of milk production includes hiring label, feeding cost, insurance cost, and etc. From the data set, we would like to know the following question: What is the difference in returns of milk production among different states from the Gross Value of Production (Milk Sold, Cattle, and other income)? How does the cost of hiring labor changed from 2016 to 2020 in the New York State? Is there any positive or negative correlation between the cost of Purchased Feed and the profit of Milk Sold from 2016 to 2020? In the next chapters, we will discuss about these questions, and provide our insights regarding to these aspects in a new way. Hopefully, after reading our project, the authors will learn some interesting facts about the milk production in the United States. Also, we will working hard to encourage the reader to think about the Milk Production in the United States from different aspects after reading our project.

"],["data-sources.html", "Chapter 2 Data sources 2.1 Milk Cost of Production Estimates", " Chapter 2 Data sources The primary data source we used for this project is the Economic Research Service of the U.S.Department of Agriculture *(ERS)*. ERS makes estimates of the milk production costs by using the dairy version of the data from the Agricultural Resource Management Survey (ARMS).The estimates the ERS made are based both on the actual data gathered from the ARMS and the estimating models. ERS updated the estimates twice a year, one in May and one in October. October released the final version. The estimates is annual milk cost of production estimates by State and by size of the operation. The Milk Cost of Production Estimates data is better used with non-analytical purposes. More information and background of the data can be found at this webpage. All members of our team are responsible for collecting the data. The data is collected by directly download the .xlsx file from the official webpage of the Economic Research Service. While we are deciding which dataset is better to illstate our purposes, we also considered another data set called U.S. Food Imports. There is a dairy section in the data set. However, we finally decided that the milk production data can better express the milk related problem in the United States rather than the import activity. More details about the data set we used for this project are as follows: 2.1 Milk Cost of Production Estimates This data set was downloaded from the Economic Research Service contains the milk production data of the United States from 2016-2020. ## Commodity CommodityId Category CategoryId Item Item2 ## Length:2900 Min. :180 Length:2900 Min. :1.000 Length:2900 Length:2900 ## Class :character 1st Qu.:180 Class :character 1st Qu.:2.000 Class :character Class :character ## Mode :character Median :180 Mode :character Median :2.000 Mode :character Mode :character ## Mean :180 Mean :2.655 ## 3rd Qu.:180 3rd Qu.:3.000 ## Max. :180 Max. :6.000 ## ItemId Units UnitsAbr UnitsId Region RegionId ## Min. : 220.0 Length:2900 Length:2900 Min. :193.0 Length:2900 Min. : 10.0 ## 1st Qu.: 570.0 Class :character Class :character 1st Qu.:230.0 Class :character 1st Qu.:167.5 ## Median : 815.0 Mode :character Mode :character Median :230.0 Mode :character Median :215.0 ## Mean : 718.1 Mean :229.1 Mean :207.6 ## 3rd Qu.: 900.0 3rd Qu.:230.0 3rd Qu.:262.5 ## Max. :1070.0 Max. :240.0 Max. :310.0 ## Country CountryId Year Value SurveyBaseYear Note ## Length:2900 Min. :10 Min. :2016 Min. : -10.210 Length:2900 Length:2900 ## Class :character 1st Qu.:10 1st Qu.:2017 1st Qu.: 0.270 Class :character Class :character ## Mode :character Median :10 Median :2018 Median : 1.225 Mode :character Mode :character ## Mean :10 Mean :2018 Mean : 717.476 ## 3rd Qu.:10 3rd Qu.:2019 3rd Qu.: 9.953 ## Max. :10 Max. :2020 Max. :23579.000 ## Order Size SizeId ## Min. : 350.0 Length:2900 Min. :90 ## 1st Qu.: 720.0 Class :character 1st Qu.:90 ## Median : 960.0 Mode :character Median :90 ## Mean : 861.7 Mean :90 ## 3rd Qu.:1050.0 3rd Qu.:90 ## Max. :1230.0 Max. :90 Table 2.1: Major variables used Item2 Region Year Value Note Milk sold U.S. total 2016 16.83 Revenue of sold milk Purchased feed California 2016 7.70 Purchased feed Total, feed costs Illinois 2017 11.21 Cost of feeding milk cows Taxes and insurance Kentucky 2016 0.13 Taxe and insurance cost Total, costs listed New York 2016 25.38 Total cost Output per cow (pounds) Pennsylvania 2016 19915.00 The amount of milk per cow produced in pounds These are the major variables used for this project. Item2: listed the categories of cost or revenue activities. Region: states of the United States Year: the record year Value: the amount of money, corresponds to the categories of Item2 Issues with this data set: Even though this data set is well organized. It still has some issues. 1. The data value is not accurate enough to be used for analysis purposes.By reading the data set background on Economic Research Services official website, it is easier to find that some amount of the data is estimated by using actual data and model. It makes sense that it is difficult to ask and gather milk production and seeling data from farmers, because it requires lots of work, and farmers may even do not know exactly how much they paid or gained in the milk production industry. 2. The data set only covers milk production data of 19 States of the United States. It could be that the amount of milk production and seeling can be ignored compared to these 19 States. However, it is imappropreate to just treat the milk production of the other States as NO MILK PRODUCED at all.

The above two plot tells different information about one data set. Each one of them has some limitations of showing some aspects of the data. However, if we considering the two plots together, We can understand this data more comprehensively. 6.1 Description of the first interactive plot The first interactive plot is a graph with multiple lines, where each line represents a State of the United States. Each State has been assigned with a color so it is easier for the reader to recognize each State. Colors are randomlly assigned because similar colors represent connections in some way, and it is not reasonable to assume that there are relationships among each State regarding to the total revenue gained. It is easier for the readers to compare the trend of the total revenue gained among different States, or to find the trend of changing in total revenue among years of one State.The advantage of this graph is that it can show the total revenue trend very clearly! However, the disadvantage is that is it difficult to compare which parts of the United States tend to receive more revenue on selling milk or milk product. That means, the distribution of the total revenue of States cannot be shown on this graph. Instructions for using the plot Clicking on the State names on the right, and the corresponding line can be added or deleted in the plot. Each color represents one State, so the readers will not get confused about which line match to which State. The units of the Y-axis is dollars per hundred pounds of milk sold 6.2 Description of the second interactive plot Compare to the previous plot, this interactive map plot is good at showing the distribution of the total revunue on a map of the United States, however, it is difficult to tell from this interactive plot about the change of the total revenue of each States among the years since the diiference in degree of blue is not as clear as numbers. Instructions for using the map Movivng the mouse on the State to see the States name and the total revenue in dollars per hundred pounds of weight sold. Select the year on the upper left to see the total revenue map of year 2016-2020. references: 1.https://bl.ocks.org/dnprock/5215cc464cfb9affd283 2.https://bl.ocks.org/d3noob/635735a3de2909ae06669096fbadc0ed 3.https://github.com/topojson/us-atlas 4.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKw0KCH9rZA "],["conclusion.html", "Chapter 7 Conclusion", " Chapter 7 Conclusion "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
