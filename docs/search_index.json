I believe that at most of the time, it will be Milk! Milk is very important in our daily life. We can directly drink it, and we can also drink it with coffee, or with cereal. Many food are made with milk, such as cheese, ice-cream, and etc. Milk is everywhere in our life! According to Statista, the U.S per capita consumption of dairy products is around 655 pounds in 2020. With the large consumption of milk in the U.S, it stimulates our interests that how much milk is produced every year in the United States and how much profits can farmers make by selling milk and milk products? With the curiosity about the milk production in the United States, we went to the U.s. Department of Agriculture and the Economic Research Service website, and found an interesting data set called Milk Cost of Production Estimates, which includes the average pounds of milk produced each year among the States in the U.S.The data set also includes the income, expenditure, and opportunity cost of milk production from year 2016 to year 2020. The income category includes the money gained from selling milk, milk products, and etc. The cost categories of milk production includes hiring label, feeding cost, insurance cost, and etc. From the data set, we would like to know the following question: What is the difference in returns of milk production among different states from the Gross Value of Production (Milk Sold, Cattle, and other income)? How does the cost of hiring labor changed from 2016 to 2020 in the New York State? Is there any positive or negative correlation between the cost of Purchased Feed and the profit of Milk Sold from 2016 to 2020? In the next chapters, we will discuss about these questions, and provide our insights regarding to these aspects in a new way. Hopefully, after reading our project, the authors will learn some interesting facts about the milk production in the United States. Also, we will working hard to encourage the reader to think about the Milk Production in the United States from different aspects after reading our project.

"],["data-sources.html", "Chapter 2 Data sources 2.1 Milk Cost of Production Estimates 2.2 Other Minor Date Set used", " Chapter 2 Data sources The primary data source we used for this project is the Economic Research Service of the U.S.Department of Agriculture *(ERS)*. ERS makes estimates of the milk production costs by using the dairy version of the data from the Agricultural Resource Management Survey (ARMS).The estimates the ERS made are based both on the actual data gathered from the ARMS and the estimating models. ERS updated the estimates twice a year, one in May and one in October. October released the final version. The estimates is annual milk cost of production estimates by State and by size of the operation. The Milk Cost of Production Estimates data is better used with non-analytical purposes. More information and background of the data can be found at this webpage. All members of our team are responsible for collecting the data. The data is collected by directly download the .xlsx file from the official webpage of the Economic Research Service. While we are deciding which dataset is better to illstate our purposes, we also considered another data set called U.S. Food Imports. There is a dairy section in the data set. However, we finally decided that the milk production data can better express the milk related problem in the United States rather than the import activity. More details about the data set we used for this project are as follows: 2.1 Milk Cost of Production Estimates This data set was downloaded from the Economic Research Service contains the milk production data of the United States from 2016-2020.

It still has some issues. The data value is not accurate enough to be used for analysis purposes.By reading the data set background on Economic Research Services official website, it is easier to find that some amount of the data is estimated by using actual data and model. It makes sense that it is difficult to ask and gather milk production and seeling data from farmers, because it requires lots of work, and farmers may even do not know exactly how much they paid or gained in the milk production industry. The data set only covers milk production data of 19 States of the United States. It could be that the amount of milk production and seeling can be ignored compared to these 19 States. However, it is imappropreate to just treat the milk production of the other States as NO MILK PRODUCED at all. 2.2 Other Minor Date Set used name.tsv name.tsv is a flie about the States names and their abbreviations of the United States.

"],["data-transformation.html", "Chapter 3 Data transformation 3.1 Data Overview 3.2 Data Preprocessing 3.3 Data Transformation for Interactive Plot", " Chapter 3 Data transformation 3.1 Data Overview We collected most of our data from the United States Department of Agriculture website. The major data set we used, Annual Milk Cost of Production Estimates data by state and the size of operation from 2016 to 2020, is downloadable in the form of an Excel spreadsheet in these following links: Split by State Split by Size of Operation ) The 2 data sets, in Excel spreadsheet form, each contains 2 sheets. The first sheet is a pivot table, in which each segmentation, including either U.S. states or sizes of operations, is wide-pivoted and includes specific price-related information, such as items from value of production, operating costs, allocated overhead, and calculated information such as total costs and net value. In the second sheet, each of the pivoted information is in the tabular data sheet format, in which each row in the pivot table, is given an item ID, corresponding to specific items such as hired labor cost, taxes and insurance, gross value of milk sold, etc. Due to the nature of the data format, we can only process the tabular data. Therefore we load the second data sheet as a csv into RStudio. We present all the categories in the data below: Category Gross value of production Operating costs Allocated overhead Costs listed Net value Supporting information Each category correspond to multiple items, and we present all the items below: Item Milk sold Cattle Other income Â¹ Total, gross value of production Purchased feed Homegrown harvested feed Grazed feed Total, feed costs Veterinary and medicine Bedding and litter Marketing Custom services Fuel, lube, and electricity Repairs Other, operating costs Â² Interest on operating capital Total, operating costs Hired labor Opportunity cost of unpaid labor Capital recovery of machinery and equipment Â³ Opportunity cost of land Taxes and insurance General farm overhead Total, allocated overhead Total, costs listed Value of production less total costs listed Value of production less operating costs Milk cows Output per cow Among the data set segmented by state, 7 operation sizes depending on the number of cows in production are included, plus one for U.S. total. We present all the regions as follows: Size Fewer than 50 cows 50-99 cows 100-199 cows 200-499 cows 500-999 cows 1,000-1,999 cows 2,000 cows or more All sizes Among the data set segmented by size of operations, include 19 U.S. major production states, plus one for U.S. total. We present all the regions as follows: Region U.S. total California Illinois Indiana Iowa Kentucky Maine Michigan Minnesota Missouri New York Ohio Oregon Pennsylvania Tennessee Utah Vermont Virginia Washington Wisconsin 3.2 Data Preprocessing We first remove some of the excessive fields, such as the first 2 columns as there is no variations in these 2 fields. We can easily pick the data we want by filtering from the descriptive columns. For example, we can select all the data in one year, or selecting only the profit items (with item_ID = 950) corresponding to U.S. total. We may also use dplyr to select the desired columns and perform grouping. Region Value California 0.94 Illinois -5.36 Indiana -4.55 Iowa -2.17 Kentucky -2.29 Maine -6.21 Michigan -4.67 Minnesota -2.21 Missouri -6.39 New York -6.08 Ohio -3.70 Oregon -1.91 Pennsylvania -5.13 Tennessee -5.85 Utah -1.63 Vermont -6.96 Virginia -3.62 Washington -0.72 Wisconsin -0.86 In the further analysis, we have also used joins in order to calculate ratios that use one value divided by another. For example, in order to calculate the percentage of milk sold value among the total gross value of production, we can do so: x 0.8933121 0.8796042 0.8263209 0.8824443 0.8939394 0.8931419 0.9314111 0.8289269 0.9042609 0.8868708 0.9191710 0.8996781 0.9096126 0.9029276 0.8910192 0.9075998 0.9130237 0.8927318 0.8784615 0.9050251 We can easily use dplyr and tidyr to convert the format of the data from tabular long data to wide tidy data using pivot_wide function.

"],["results.html", "Chapter 5 Results 5.1 Correlogram", " Chapter 5 Results 5.1 Correlogram First, in order to have a more intuitive understanding of the different items within the dataset, we used a correlogram, i.e., a pairwise matrix that visualize the correlation coefficient between each pair of features within a dataset. We do so by first pivoting both data sets to a tidy wide form, making each single item to be a column and a combination of Year and Region/Size to be a unique row. Then we renamed the Region and Size from 2 data sets to be Category so that we can use rbind function to merge them. Since we only care about the inner correlation between each item, whether the data was segmented by Region or Size of Farm does not make a difference. We then round the correlation matrix to 3 decimal places and use ggcorrplot function to plot the correlogram, in which a highly positive correlation is indicated by bright green and highly negative correlation is indicated by bright red, with white meaning weak correlation. From the correlogram we can easily interpret the relationships between some important features and also conduct some sanity checks to make sure the data we applied is correct. For example, it can be observed that the value of production less total costs listed has a very negative correlation with total costs listed, which makes sense. It can also be observed that total allocated overhead is very positively correlated with total costs listed. Overall, the pattern we can observe from this correlogram is that items under Net Value category tends to have a positive correlation with items under Gross Value of Production items, and a negative correlation with items under Allocated Overhead and Operating Costs categories, which meets our expectation because in general, net value equals gross value of production minus allocated overhead and operating costs. We are interested in the movement of unit milk price across different years from 2016 to 2020. Since it is a univariate analysis, it makes sense to use a histogram to visualize its distribution. We also chose to use facet wrap function to graph the price distribution in different years. To better illustrate the distribution, we add a trend line to highlight the peak and tails. As we can see from the graph, the unit price of milk does not follow a constant increasing trend. In 2016, the peak lies at about $17 per hundredweight, and it goes up in 2017 to around $18.5. Then in 2018, it fell back to even a lower level than 2016. In 2019, the peak of unit milk price suddenly increased to around $19.5 per hundredweight, followed by a slight decrease back to around $18.5 in 2020. Overall, we dont observe any patterns from the milk unit price, other than the fact that it is always changing. We also utilized the ggvis package to build an interactive histogram that summarizes all the unit milk prices over the last 5 years. By dragging the width bar, we are able to change to change the number of bins respectively. For example, if we set the bar width to be 1.1, we notice the peak of milk price in the last 5 years lies between $18 and $19. Renderer: SVG | Canvas Download Over the years, one thing we are interested in is how the U.S. total milk production in pounds moves. Although our original datasets do not include that part of information, we are able to download the data from USDAs QuickStats tool here. This dataset includes the time series data of U.S. total milk production from 2000 to 2020. Since the granularity of data available is only specific to month of year, we impute the date to be the 15th of each month to convert the combination of year and month to a date. We then visualized the movement of milk production in lbs from 2000 to 2020 in the following graph, using color to represent the production level. As we can observe here, the milk production follows a steady increase trend across years, with some up-and-downs fluctuating within smaller intervals. An obvious explanation to this trend is that cows have milking seasons within years, and over longer terms the increase of population demands higher milk output over time. We may also visualize the total production in one year in each subplot and use facet wrap function to split between different years. As we can observe from the second graph, we noticed the milk output in each year tends to reach peak between March and May, and usually has a low point in February. The increasing trend over years can also be easily observed here because of the color change. We can see an obvious line color change from red to green, meaning the total production level increases over years. One aspect of this data we are particularly interested in is the profitability for milk farms across the country, which can be indicated by the item: gross value of production less total costs. The value of production less total costs listed, which can be read equivalently as profit, is calculated by subtracting the total cost listed from the total gross value of production. We noticed there are gross value of production less operating costs as well, but for the purpose of analysis we consider both operating costs and allocated overhead as its a more comprehensive reflection of the profitability across all major milk production states in the U.S. We used a highchart to present the value of production less total costs listed distribution in 2020 among the states on a map. The reason why we choose highchart is that it can show a clear distribution of different states along with comparison of values between them given the Region field from dataset. By moving the cursor on top of each state, we can get the detail number of the profit in $ per hundredweight milk sold. The existence of grey states in the graph are due to the lack of data in these states. As we covered in the missing data pattern section, most U.S. states in the mid region are not major U.S. states, while most major milk production states lie in either the Northeast part or the Northwest part of U.S. As we can see from the color bar, when the color of a state is redder, it presents less value of production less total costs listed, which means a more negative profit. Vice versa, when the color of a state is greener, it shows more value of production fewer total costs listed which means more profit. From the plot we can find the northeast of United States has relatively more loss, especially Vermont has the highest loss among all states. However, in the west side things gets better. In Washington, Oregon, and California there are all positive profit numbers. Especially in California, the profit reaches 2.48 dollars per hundred weights sold which is the highest in United States. It might because California has more suitable climate and larger grassland area, or there might be other reasons causing this, but we are not currently able to draw the conclusion from this graph. The last graph can only visualize how different states make profits in one year. We can also use the hc_motion function from highcharter to visualize the same results across different years. Here the color of each state still represents the unit profit per hundredweight milk, and we can drag the bar on bottom left to select different years. Across the recent 5 years, we observed that California still stands as the most profitable milk production state. Since 2019, most northeast milk production states continued to suffer from net loss, potentially due to the competition between farms. From the gross value of production categories, we can observe usually milk sold consists of a bulk among the total value of productions. So we are curious about how the percentage of milk sold among gross value of production distributes in different states, and how that has an influence upon the profitability of milk production in each state. Since Cleveland Dot Plot is a nice way to visualize a ratio, considering a bar chart here is too cluttered because there are many states. We draw a Cleveland Dot Plot by picking gross value, milk sold and profit from the original dataset. After combining them into a tidy long dataframe, we calculate the portion of milk sold in gross value of production. We also set a color palette to make sure the profit color representation is consistent: a green dot implies high profit, and a red dot implies overall high loss per hundredweight milk sold. The x-axis represents the percentage of milk sold value among gross value of production. We have also reordered the states so that they are ordered in descending order of ratio we just calculated. The dots representing U.S. total are highlighted to be larger for easier observation. As we can observe from the dot plot, the distribution of milk among production value ratio ranges between 0.8 and 1. Maine is the state in which the milk sold value weighs the most within the total gross production value, and Illinois is the state where it weighs the least. We also observed that most profitable states tend not to have a too high, or too low milk among production value ratio, for example, California, Wisconsin, and Oregon. And states with either an extremely high or low ratio suffer from overall loss per hundredweight sold, as indicated by the red dots we see. Equivalently, we can conduct the same analysis on the data segmented by sizes of farms instead of states. From the plot, we note that the size of farms does not seem to have a direct correlation with the ratio of milk among gross value of production here. However, there exists a clear pattern of color from top to bottom, indicating that farms with larger sizes tend to be more profitable compared with smaller ones. Especially, farms with fewer than 50 cows all suffer from an overall loss. This can be explained by the economies of scale effect, meaning the cost advantages that are obtained due to larger scale of operation brings higher profit. From the last analysis part, we have observed how the size of farms has an influence on the profitability of farms. Here we would like to take a closer look at the variations among different sizes of farms and their outputs. For easier comparisons, we chose bar plots to compare the output of milk per cow in pounds among different sized farms. We chose to use bar chart because it is easy to understand and can show changes over time which is suitable for our analysis. As before, we use the color of bar to represent the profitability of farms of different sizes. From the graph we can observe that the medium size farm has largest output per cow. And the largest sized farms have higher output per cow compared with the smallest farms. It might because the larger size farm has more advanced technology along with better feed and breeds of cow. Note that since the unit output is the same across all years, we are only using the data from 2016 here. Same applies to the next graph. We are also interested in the total outputs for different sized farms. We still use a bar chart to analyze the total outputs in pounds among different sized farms. Different from the previous one, at this time the total outputs are calculated by multiplying of output per cow and the number of cows among different sized farms. In this graph we can see that the larger farm has larger number of total outputs, which is in line with common sense. By observing the All Sizes bar, we can have some interesting finding. The All Sizes represent the average outputs in pounds among different sized farms. Here the total output corresponding to All Sizes is very close to the value of smaller (100-199 cows) farms. So, it is reasonable to infer that the small farms accounts for most of the farms included in the United States. In order to have a better understanding of how yearly revenue varies among states, we choose to use scatter plot to present the relationship between yearly profit and marketing costs. Here the profit per hundredweight sold is the value of production fewer operating costs, which can be seen as incoming cashflow per hundredweight of milk sold since we did not consider the allocated overhead here. Another factor we would like to consider here is the marketing cost, as marketing costs usually plays a critical role in determining if a company makes profit or not. We would like test if this held true for our milk production case. We decided to use a scatter plot to visualize the relationship between profit per hundredweight milk sold and marketing costs. In addition to the value of marketing costs, we figured it also makes sense to consider the ratio of marketing costs among total operating costs. So we calculated this ratio and use the color of dots to denote the ratio of marketing cost among total operating costs, with red meaning marketing costs weigh more than 2% among total operating costs and blue meaning less than 0.5%. In the scatter plot each circle means the profit per hundredweight sold vs. marketing cost per hundredweight sold for each state in one year. We can see that Pennsylvania both has the highest marketing cost per hundredweight sold compared with other states and spends higher marketing cost among operating cost. However, it does not help in making profit for Pennsylvania farms as it still suffers from a net loss among all years. Missouri, on the other side, has the lowest marketing cost per hundredweight sold compared with other states and spends lower marketing cost among operating cost. However, the overall profitability of Missouri and Pennsylvania doesnt differ by a lot, disproving the significance of how marketing costs influences profitability in this case. As for California, the state with the most profitable milk farms, it does not have a high marketing cost per hundredweight sold but it does spend a large percentage of its operating costs on marketing. At least for California, we understand that spending money on marketing milk paid off, unlike Pennsylvania. From the previous analysis, we can easily tell California is the one state that all farms from other states should learn from. What is the secret of California milk farms that makes them keep profitable in the long term? Our first hypothesis is Californias higher food price. Maybe the milk from California can sell as a better price, so the total value of production becomes naturally higher. To verify our guess, we visualized the items from gross value of production between California and U.S. total. This includes 3 items: cattle, milk sold and other incomes. Since all 3 items together make total value of production, we can use a stacked bar chart to represent them. As we can observe from this graph, California does not produce significantly higher value of milk compared to the average country level. So, this is not the reason why California milk farms are profitable. Another hypothesis is: if not revenue, then the reason must be the costs, as only these 2 terms are pertained to profit. To explore on this, we first visualized the 2 sources of costs, operating costs and allocated overhead of California versus all other states to see if we find something. In this graph, red bar represents total allocated overhead and blue bar represents total operating costs. We notice California farms did a good job controlling their costs: not only do they have a lower operating cost, but they also have a significantly low allocated overhead. This may most likely be caused by the economies of scale, but well dig a little more into that. There are 2 parts of costs, and we are going to get into details on both of them. First, we can look at operating costs of California versus U.S. total. We still used a stacked bar chart to compare their components. We can observe that the purple bar, representing purchase feed, is a major part of operating costs. However, California farms even spend more money on purchase feed compared to national average. On the other hand, the light green bar, representing homegrown harvested feed, is the reason why California farms has a lower operating cost than other farms, as we can see it is significantly lower compared to national average. Lastly, we can look at the allocated overhead part. The difference is very obvious. California farms spend much less on allocated overhead compared to national average farms, both in terms of total overhead, and in terms of opportunity cost of unpaid labor. California farms almost spend nothing on this item, while most farms in other parts of U.S. spent a considerate amount on this. We are able to draw the conclusion: California milk farms remains profitable compared to other farms in the U.S. because they generally do a good job controlling costs, especially including opportunity cost of unpaid labor and homegrown harvested feed. The reason why they can keep these 2 costs at a low level constantly is most likely due to economies of scale. "],["interactive-component.html", "Chapter 6 Interactive component 6.1 Description of the first interactive plot 6.2 Description of the second interactive plot", " Chapter 6 Interactive component The aim of this section is to show to the readers that how one data file can be used to draw plots in different point of views, and how information shown from one plot could be limited. The above two plot tells different information about one data set. Each one of them has some limitations of showing some aspects of the data. However, if we considering the two plots together, We can understand this data more comprehensively. 6.1 Description of the first interactive plot The first interactive plot is a graph with multiple lines, where each line represents a State of the United States. Each State has been assigned with a color so it is easier for the reader to recognize each State. Colors are randomlly assigned because similar colors represent connections in some way, and it is not reasonable to assume that there are relationships among each State regarding to the total revenue gained. It is easier for the readers to compare the trend of the total revenue gained among different States, or to find the trend of changing in total revenue among years of one State.The advantage of this graph is that it can show the total revenue trend very clearly! However, the disadvantage is that is it difficult to compare which parts of the United States tend to receive more revenue on selling milk or milk product. That means, the distribution of the total revenue of States cannot be shown on this graph. Instructions for using the plot Clicking on the State names on the right, and the corresponding line can be added or deleted in the plot. Each color represents one State, so the readers will not get confused about which line match to which State. The units of the Y-axis is dollars per hundred pounds of milk sold 6.2 Description of the second interactive plot Compare to the previous plot, this interactive map plot is good at showing the distribution of the total revunue on a map of the United States, however, it is difficult to tell from this interactive plot about the change of the total revenue of each States among the years since the diiference in degree of blue is not as clear as numbers. Instructions for using the map Movivng the mouse on the State to see the States name and the total revenue in dollars per hundred pounds of weight sold. Select the year on the upper left to see the total revenue map of year 2016-2020. references: These are the usefu examples of D3 graphs that help us learn how to draw the graph above. 1.references: https://bl.ocks.org/dnprock/5215cc464cfb9affd283 2.references:https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/4060606 3.references: https://bl.ocks.org/adamjanes/6cf85a4fd79e122695ebde7d41fe327f 4.references: https://bl.ocks.org/denisemauldin/3436a3ae06f73a492228059a515821fe 5.references: https://gist.github.com/lbui30/65c2707e615841efaf35959aedac8ca9 "],["conclusion.html", "Chapter 7 Conclusion", " Chapter 7 Conclusion "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
