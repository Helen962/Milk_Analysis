[["conclusion.html", "Chapter 7 Conclusion", " Chapter 7 Conclusion In this project, we have used methods we learned from the exploratory data analysis and visualization to explore on the United States Department of Agriculture data about milk farm productions. By visualizing relevant data components through various graphs, we are able to have a more comprehensive and deeper understanding of how the milk farms production distributes in the United States. There are a few key takeaways that are not explicit through looking at the dataset. However, by the means of data transformation and visualizations, we are able to draw some conclusions by observing on the graphs. First, we are able to show the trend of United States total milk production outputs in the past 20 years is steady increasing. Although there are some fluctuations between years, it is obvious that the overall trend is going up, due to the increase in population and therefore growing needs in dairy supplies. Also, we learned that although milk production output is increasing, there exists no steady patterns for the movement of prices over years. We have also identified the two major regions for United States milk production: northeast and northwest regions. Most states in the northeast region suffer from a net loss, while most states in the northwest are profitable over years, especially milk farms in California. If we look at farms segmented by sizes of production instead of states, we can easily observe the economies of scale effects, as the larger a farm is, it is much more likely to be profitable over years compared to smaller-sized farms. Most small milk farms struggle to maintain a positive cash flow. Last but not least, we took a detailed look at how California, the best state in terms of milk farm profitability nationally, maintained profitable versus other states. The major reasons consist of both operating cost and allocated overhead: in terms of operating cost, California milk farms are especially good at controlling homegrown harvest fed cost. In terms of allocated overhead, California milk farms almost leave no opportunity cost of unpaid labor, possibly through the means of large-scale production, to take an advantage in generating profit in milk products.
